### cloning and installation

- just copy the link and then just write git clone (url) in git bash

- for basic structure - react js/ vite
- for styling - tailwindcss
- for animation - framer motion

## Colour combo

- you can find the colour combo in the index.css file ( example text-chai ) chai color will be shown

## suggestions

- Create a folder in your name , all all the componets you are creating can be added there , after we all review it we can add it in the main code
- make a readme in that file, describing what are you doing example - login/logout form - break them down , make small components and build the later we can together descide on adding or removing it

  - list of the componets - from here everyone can select one and then mark it as selected which ever you preffered
  - Forms
  - navigations
  - modals
  - overlays
  - cards
  - product display
  - E-commerce Product page
  - Profile Page
  - Dashboard page

### Things to be taken care of

- for any components in vite you must use .jsx as an extention
- npm run dev - to run the program
